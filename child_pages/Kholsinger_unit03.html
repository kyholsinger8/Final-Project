<h2 class="w3-wide">My life with my little cat family</h2>


<article>

<h3>There's always been a place for cats in my heart</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">I have always loved cats since I was little mostly because they were cute and quiet and I would always get jealous of my friends who had them. My interest in cats grew as I got older which is why had a lot of t-shirts with cats on them. Over the five years of being with my fiancé I have been helping take care of our 4 cats. 
My fiancé has had cats in her life ever since she was born but got a cat that was just for her at three years old, this cat's name is Barbie. After about a year and a half of dating we adopted two cats, a brother and sister named Neki and Cho. About a year later we adopted an albino kitty named Yuki.
