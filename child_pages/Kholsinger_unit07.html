<h3>Part One</h3>
<div id="paragraph">
<p class="w3-justify">The stunning red bridge is eye-catching, especially from far away, and when you are on it you get a nice view of the garden. I’ve been coming here ever since I was 8 years old and I often go when I go back to Cali once a year. Once I fell while walking on the stones in the pond I can still remember how it felt, especially the koi brushing up against me. It was quite an odd feeling. If my grandmother is still alive I would like to have a small wedding reception or something of the sort because it’s a very special place to me.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">Old Sacramento is a place that comes to mind when I think of <span id="california-bold"> California </span>. I often went there when I was young and occasionally when I was older. The first thing we would usually do is walk around, get some food and eventually go to a candy store. Me and my brother would usually eat so much taffy that we would make ourselves sick.

<h3>Part Two</h3>
<div id="paragraph2">
<p class="w3-justify"><span id="sanfran"> San Francisco </span> is a wonderful place, I would usually spend the first day back in California driving around with my dad. The first thing we would do is get bread often at the Boudin Bakery which has fantastic sourdough bread and exquisite soup. Next, we would walk around pier 39. The smell of the sea lions often grossed me out as a kid but now it’s weirdly a nostalgic smell. Once we had spent some time walking around my dad would take me to Japan town. Specifically, the peace plaza which has good places to eat and really cool shops that would sell anything from high quality stationery to figures of Godzilla and Gundam model kits which I build occasionally.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">My <span id="fiancé"> fiancé </span> came out with me in 2019, it was memorable and mind-blowing to me that I could show someone where I spent all my summers as a kid. She had never been to the west coast and had never experienced weather consistently in the 90s. I was worried about her most of the time when we were there. I often helped her cool off and made sure she drank a lot of water. My grandmother was also lovely to her and treated her own granddaughter. It was a very special vacation that I will never forget and remains very special to me and I constantly think about going back to Cali for a few days to see my Dad and grandparents because it truly feels like I have a second home out there.
