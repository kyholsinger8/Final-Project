<h2 class="w3-wide">Short Biography</h2>

<article>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p class="w3-justify">On August 25th, 1998, my twin brother and I were born in Palo Alto California then we spent the first four years of our lives living in northern California. My mom is from Ohio and my dad is from California so when my parents eventually separated my mom, brother, and I moved to Ohio to live with her parents until she could get back on her feet. Initially, I didn’t like growing up in Ohio and thought it was boring and kind of miserable, which made me look forward to summertime which I would always spend back in California. I was consistently bullied from most of middle school to early high school which gave me lots of self-confidence issues and anger issues which have partially gone away with years of therapy. 
</p>
<p class="w3-justify"> I’ve always felt hopeless and purposeless in life, it was easy to hate myself and ruin my mood. Being happy and confident is something I have struggled with for a long time. I would get up in the morning disappointed I woke up and dread going to school but I would be happy thinking about seeing my friends. I learned to enjoy things more and become happy and enjoy things more partially with the help of anti-depressants and a stimulant. Something I have struggled with is my Adhd, my learning disabilities and my autism. Sometimes I wish I was neurotypical and could focus so I wouldn’t waste time and struggle with things the majority of people can do easily.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify">I have been with my fiancé for five years and engaged for two. We started as friends in high school but became a couple when I started college. Through our time we have helped each other grow and overcome hard times. My fiancé has helped me overcome my bad drinking and cigarette habits and has overall helped me become healthier. We have even started a little cat family of four.

<h3>Career Plans</h3>
<p class="w3-justify"> In terms of career, I have been conflicted early on as I gravitated towards wanting to be a concept artist for movies and video games, which is something I wanted to do since I was 9. In high school, I realized the concept art field was extremely difficult to get into but that’s not the main problem. The main problem is the pay it's unstable and even established artists don’t make that much. For example, there is a card game called Magic the gathering that has extremely impressive art however, the artists are only paid 2000 dollars per card. While that might seem good from what I have seen most artists only make a few cards.
</p>
<p class="w3-justify"> After being discouraged, I moved on to graphic design, which is something that resonates with me as I love the packaging and clever adverts but mostly the packaging. I began taking digital art classes as a sophomore and had a lot of fun with some of the projects. I ended up taking three digital art courses, the third being an independent study that piqued my interest in graphic design. Even though I am finishing up a degree in graphic design, I have always been interested in tattoos. It's an extremely different and challenging medium it just can be so cool and so special for some people immortalizing family and pets. Currently, I work in an Epoxy and paint distribution warehouse, which is where I plan to work until I can tattoo full time and freelance graphic design, I simply want to make enough money to survive with my fiancé and our 4 cats.
